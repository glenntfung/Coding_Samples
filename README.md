# About this repo

This repo contains several coding samples, in Python, R, Stata, MATLAB and Julia. Below is a summary of these scripts. 

## Python sample 

This script is actually a comination of multiple scripts that were used to execute one project related to teaching evaluations. 

## R sample 



## Stata sample 



## MATLAB sample



## Julia sample



# Q&A

1. **Question**: What is your proficiency of each language above?

   **Answer**: I am proficient in Python, R, and Stata. I have used MATLAB and Julia for several times, and my level is beyond introductory. I write MATLAB better than Julia. 

2. **Question**: What other languages, computer programs, or software, do you have experience in?

   **Answer**: Here is a complete list I can think of. 

   * Data analysis and computation: Stata, R, Julia, Tableau, MATALB, VBA, SQL, Minitab, SPSS, Mathematica
   * General purpose: Python, C
   * Optimization: LINGO, NetLogo, Gephi
   * Typesetting: HTML, LaTeX (including TikZ), Mermaid, Visio, Microsoft 365
   * Others: Adobe PS/AU/LR/PR/AE, ImageJ
   * R packages: `bayesplot`, `boot`, `BradleyTerry2`, `brms`, `BSBT`, `car`, `caret`, `causalTree`, `coda`, `data.table`, `dirichletprocess`, `dplyr`, `e1071`, `forecast`, `ggplot2`, `ggpubr`, `grf`, `haven`, `ISLR`, `ivreg`, `keras`, `lubridate`, `MASS`, `MatchIt`, `plm`, `prefmod`, `qvcalc`, `randomForest`, `readxl`, `rmarkdown`, `rstan`, `shiny`, `stringr`, `tidyr`, `tidyverse`, `xgboost`, `zoo`
   * Python packages: `arviz`, `beautifulsoup4`, `causalml`, `cmath`, `collections`, `csv`, `datetime`, `deep-sort-realtime`, `deepface`, `distance`, `dlib`, `econml`, `ensurepip`, `estimate`, `faker`, `glob`, `graphviz`, `itertools`, `json`, `jupyter`, `keras`, `loss`, `math`, `matplotlib`, `mlxtend`, `moviepy`, `multiprocessing`, `near`, `networkx`, `nltk`, `numpy`, `numpy_financial`, `openpyxl`, `operator`, `os`, `pandas`, `pickle`, `pillow`, `pyaudioanalysis`, `pyarrow`, `pycocotools`, `pydub`, `pymc`, `pytorch`, `random`, `requests`, `SALib`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `selenium`, `seaborn`, `speechbrain`, `stan`, `statsmodels`, `statistics`, `tensorflow`, `time`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, `transformers`, `ultralytics`, `whisper`, `xgboost`
   * APIs: Google speech-to-text, Face++, OpenPose, YOLO

3. **Question**: Why are the themes of the code so diverse?

   **Answer**: I have a BS degree in Applied Mathematics with Economics, and the program structure led to separated research and study in mathematics and economics. Fortunately, I am able to combine the very mathy part (involving comparative judgment) with the very behavioral part by a recent ongoing project with Professor David Ong at the J-BJI. 

4. **Question**: Further information about me?
